# Leet AI

Leet AI is a Chrome extension that provides step‑by‑step hints and feedback while solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It integrates with generative AI models so you can ask for guidance directly from the problem page.

## Features

- Chat interface to discuss problems and receive short hints
- Supports multiple models including OpenAI GPT‑3.5 Turbo, GPT‑4o and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Remembers your conversations locally using IndexedDB
- Quickly switch models or clear chat history
- Configure API keys through the popup

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18 or higher (tested with Node 22)
- **pnpm** (preferred) or npm for dependency management

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm install      # or `npm install`
pnpm run dev
```

The extension files will be built in watch mode. To test it in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Choose **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` directory generated by Vite

## Building for Production

Generate an optimized build:

```bash
pnpm run build    # or `npm run build`
```

This outputs the packaged extension to the `dist/` folder. Load this folder in Chrome as described above.

## Useful Scripts

- `pnpm run lint` &ndash; run ESLint
- `pnpm run prettier` &ndash; format source files
- `pnpm run preview` &ndash; preview the production build

## Project Structure

- `src/` &ndash; TypeScript/React source code
- `public/` &ndash; static assets (icons, etc.)
- `manifest.json` &ndash; Chrome extension manifest
